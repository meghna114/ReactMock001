# Infinite Scrolling react

This project was bootstrapped with  git([https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/meghna114/ReactMock001)).
##overview

This React application demonstrates infinite scrolling functionality. It fetches posts from API and displays them in chunks of 20. The app includes a loading indicator and I used  here 4 seconds loading, that shows up during data fetches and handles scrolling to fetch more posts as the user scrolls down.
